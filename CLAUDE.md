# RADAR — Project Notes

Attendance/HR SaaS (Base44 backend + Vite/React front-end), multi-tenant via
`company_id` on every operational entity. Roles: `super_admin` (platform),
`company_admin`, `store_manager`, `employee` (`user.app_role`).

## Billing write-gate on Safe functions (fixed 2026-08-17)

`updateAttendanceRecord`, `resolveApprovalRequest`, `createManagedRecord`, and
`createEmployee` now check `Company.status` before writing (`_billingGuard.ts`,
colocated per function directory — Deno can't import across function dirs).
`updateSupportTicket` deliberately left ungated so a suspended company keeps
its one path to fix the underlying billing problem.

## Account & danger zone (module 7, added 2026-08-18)

A portfolio-standard audit (`jospabloh/acacia-app-standard`, module 7) found
`CompanySettings.jsx` only ever exposed 3 editable fields (name, timezone,
`whatsapp_enabled`) — no data export, no danger zone. New:

- **`exportCompanyData`** (`company_admin`/`store_manager`/`super_admin`) —
  service role, but every read explicitly filtered by the caller's own
  `company_id`. Returns `Employee`, `EmployeeDocument`, `AttendanceRecord`,
  `ExtensionRequest`, `PTORequest`, `ScheduleChangeRequest`, `ShiftTemplate`,
  `Holiday` as one JSON payload; `CompanySettings.jsx` turns it into a
  client-side download.
- **"Solicitar eliminación de la empresa"** — **not** a direct delete.
  `Company.delete`'s RLS requires `role: admin` (the platform owner) —
  a tenant's own `company_admin` cannot delete their own company via RLS at
  all, by design. So this creates a `SupportTicket` (`category: 'account'`,
  `priority: 'high'`) and notifies Mission Control via the existing
  `notifyTicketCreated` function (same call `SupportCenter.jsx` already
  makes on ticket creation), same principle as every other irreversible,
  tenant-wide deletion in this portfolio going through a human rather than
  instant self-service (see `jospabloh/liuma`'s own module-7 finding for the
  cautionary counter-example of *not* doing this).

**Verified:** `npm run lint`, `npm run build` pass. No `deno`/RLS-validator
script in this repo to run locally (see the 2026-08-17 fix's PR for the same
caveat) — unverified against a live deploy.
